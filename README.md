- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ffkiri11
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in studying OS'e, math, algorithms, physics modelling (applied on electronics, robotics, aerodynamics and so on).
 
 I live in Russia, and must write some words:
     
 Free Alexey Navalny. Stop
 dictatorship in Russian Federation, Stop chemical (and other) terror and poisoning.
 Russian Federation must be state of law.
 Kick out russian and pararussian militans from Ukraine, Stop Islamic State.
